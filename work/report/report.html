<h1>A report from the course HKR DA277B VT20</h1>
</header>

<section>
<h2>S01</h2>
<p>I have worked with Github before during other projects and courses but i have not used Markdown
or Github pages before. Github pages seems like a very good tool to use when developing webpages so Im
interested in learning more. I still don't know what markdown is but i want to learn.</p>

<p>I have never created websites before, in last project course some people did but i ended up creating an
android application instead.</p>

<p>I have basically no experience in developing webpages, but i have used a application called m1mo on iPhone
that learn you the basics of HTML.</p>

<p>TIL for the section is further understanding of using Github and some basic HTML and understanding in
building webpages. Github pages was a new one as well for me so good to learn that.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S02</h2>
<p>I have no previous experiance with HTML, CSS or Javascript but i really exited for this course and learning more.</p>

  <p>HTML provides a basic structure of webpages this is enhaced by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript. CSS is used to controll formatting,
  layout and so on and JavaScript is used to controll the behavior of different elements.</p>

  <p>Your browser sends a HTTP request message to the server asking for a copy of the website. Your browser and the server uses HTTP protocol
  to communicate with each other.</p>

  <p>TIL for this section was a greater understanding how to setup webpages and importense on naming index and so on. Also a much larger understanding on
  Github. I have learn more on how to design a webpage with pictures and paragrafs for example. Learn a little on CSS but looking forward to getting more into that.
</p>

<section>
<h2>S03</h2>
<p>Before this exercise i had no previous experience in using and coding JavaScript, only language I have encountered is Java before. I really liked
your lessons on JavaScript and i learned a lot just listening to you i class.</p>
<p>For me since I had zero experiance in JavaScript i can see a lot of simmilarities to ordinary Java in the way you use if statements for loops and
so on.</p>
<p>For this exercise i have work with my previous knowledge in Java and how to think, I have looked and taken inspiration from your examples codes
and tried to further develop if to make it nicer. I have also used google and stackoverflow to solve tasks and get ideas and learn more. When further
learning CSS and styling i have used stackoverflow W3School and trial and error. I aim for grade 5 but when this is written im currently done
with grade 4. A newer tag will be added when grade 5 i complete.</p>
<p>TIL for this section is using javascript and json objects to change websites without reloading them and a further understanding of CSS.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S04</h2>
<p>Before this course i had not worked with either node/npm or any other equal programs.</p>
<p>Working with node and express if you simply follow your instructons on canvas and on your lecture it seems really easy and very nice to use but im sertain
that if you just read about it more i guess it can be very complicated and do really good stuffs. When it comes to Javascript it was nice to finally see and learn
a new languges even thou it is very equal to Java, but im looking forward to learning more and get confortable with the coding language. </p>
<p>My plan to take on this and the other coding execises is to listen and learn during your lectures and looking at your example programs you code to get further
knowledge. If i need something else working with the correct documentation and stackoverflow. </p>
<p>The way i attack grades in this course will be that i will do to grade 4 in this section i didnt find it very difficult. Since we have degree project also which
takes a lot of time now in the beginning i will try and do grade 5 if i have the time.</p>
<p>Exept node, express and javascript for TIL this section you also learned me to look at merge conflicts and how to tackle them.</p>
</section>


<section>
<h2>S05</h2>
<p>PHP seems quite hard to learn and use but its not very different from Java that we have learn before. But if seems very nice to use for structuring webpages with viewers.</p>
<p>Compared to java the syntax seems a bit different, alot more dollar signs and so on that could go wrong. The funtion part seems eqaul to java and so
does the if and loop statments aswell. </p>
<p>To comlete this task i listned to you in class and also looked at your youtube to fresh up my memory, I looked at you example code and copied a lot from you. Right know
im done with grade 3 but i aim to be finished with grade 5 before handin. </p>
<p>TIL for this section was relearning mysql and working with databases in the terminal and also PHP and XAMPP i had to learn to use a little bit.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S06</h2>
<p>From what i have learned and some information on the internet my personal thought is that Java, C++ and javascript is used the most. I have found some information that
    Python is widely used aswell and that it is a good idea to learn Python for the future which i might look into after this semester. I think at least in the near
future things will stay the same regarding languges, in the long haul its hard to say but js, java and c++ i think is here to stay. </p>
<p>For me selecting languges will be a preferens since i know java the most its easier for me to start writing but I really want to learn more js and c# aswell.</p>
<p>A recommendation is hard to give without knowing the assigment, but lets say it is a website i would say .NET MVC with C#. MVC makes it easy to understand and follow
    since its a widely used techniqe for everyone to start with and c# is one of the biggest languges and syntax is not that far of for example java which is learned a lot i school.    
</p>
<p>My TIL for this section is learning that there is a lot of different choices to be made when starting a project and better understanding what languges is good to learn on my own.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S07</h2>
<p>.NET is a templet based on C# and asp.net it seems to be good for building large and rather complex webapplications and with a good and solid starting build this easy to start creating
    pages and so on.</p>
    <p>I think this is by far the hardest excerise we have done. It was really hard to find good information online on how to use it and code in it what goes where and so on. And this is
        my first time with the C# syntax aswell made it really hard to keep up with the differences from Java. </p>
        <p>I first started to look at videos and try to learn the basics but i ended up with taking most of your code and eventually found a solution for extraxting just one of the accounts
            im overall happy with the result and aimed for grade 3 i really like this course but unfortiunally the degree project takes up alot of time aswell.</p>
            <p>My TIL for this section is better understanding of MVC.</p>
