<h2>S01</h2>
<p>I have worked with Github before during other projects and courses but i have not used Markdown
or Github pages before. Github pages seems like a very good tool to use when developing webpages so Im
interested in learning more. I still don't know what markdown is but i want to learn.

I have never created websites before, in last project course some people did but i ended up creating an
android application instead.

I have basically no experience in developing webpages, but i have used a application called m1mo on iPhone
that learn you the basics of HTML.

TIL for the section is further understanding of using Github and some basic HTML and understanding in
building webpages. Github pages was a new one as well for me so good to learn that.</p>

<h2>S02</h2>
<p>I have no previous experiance with HTML, CSS or Javascript but i really exited for this course and learning more.

  HTML provides a basic structure of webpages this is enhaced by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript. CSS is used to controll formatting,
  layout and so on and JavaScript is used to controll the behavior of different elements.

  Your browser sends a HTTP request message to the server asking for a copy of the website. Your browser and the server uses HTTP protocol
  to communicate with each other.

  TIL for this section was a greater understanding how to setup webpages and importense on naming index and so on. Also a much larger understanding on
  Github. I have learn more on how to design a webpage with pictures and paragrafs for example. Learn a little on CSS but looking forward to getting more into that.
