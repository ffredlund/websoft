<h1>My report page in the course DA377B VT20</h1>

<p><img class="float-right" src="img/Mefilip.png" width="450" height="500" alt="Picture of me"></p>



<p>My name is Filip Fredlund and I am born and raised i Malmö, Skåne. When i was little we lived very close to Malmö Stadion the fotball stadium where
  Malmö FF plays their matches.</p>
<p>As an teenager i was on every game and MFF was my biggest interest. Today I have other hobbies like computers and training but
  i still sometimes go watch my favorite fotball team. Before changeing my path in life to become a software developer is studied economics and worked as
  a investment strategist at one of Swedens biggest banks but i always knew i wanted to do something else. </p>

  <p>I would not say that programming always has been one of my interests but computer has been one. I remember my father got an offer from his job
    to buy a computer from HP though his job. He bought it for me and i got full controll of the computer as long as i fixed everything with internet
    and so on, from this day I have always been interested i computers and what it can provide for us.</p>

<p>As mentioned before outside of programming and playing computer games my biggest passion right now is working out. I go to the gym 5 times a week
  and it has really helpt me with my mindset and confidence.</p>

<p>Today i live still live in center of Malmö with my girlfriend and we often go training and do cooking together.</p>
